  <h3>Hi,</h3>
  <p>
    I’m Guillaume, an interactive developer from Paris, currently working as technical lead at the design studio <a href="http://hellohikimori.com" target="_blank">Hellohikimori</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I code mainly in <strong>Javascript</strong> but also sometimes in other languages like ActionScript 3, PHP, Python or Objective-C.

  <p>
  I studied interactive design and development at the Paris <a href="http://gobelins.fr" target="_blank">Gobelins</a> school while working at <a href="http://uzik.com" target="_blank">Uzik</a>. I like music, beer and burgers but who doesn’t? Feel free to contact me!
